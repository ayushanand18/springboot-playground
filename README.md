# Java SpringBoot Playground
> A Java SpringBoot Playground, where I create a few mini demo-projects.

# Get Started
## Installation
+ The first steps towards getting this repo running is to install JRE. I am using GitHub Codepsaces which already has it installed with the following configurations:
```sh
openjdk 17.0.8.1 2023-08-24 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Microsoft-8297089 (build 17.0.8.1+1-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Microsoft-8297089 (build 17.0.8.1+1-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```
+ To get started with a SpringBoot demo applciation, we just go to `start.spring.io` and generate a bundle from the available configurations. We download the zip, and unarchive it.
